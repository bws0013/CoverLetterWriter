Greetings <Company> Hiring Team, #I am contacting you about the <Position> position on your website.

My strongest areas are in Java, C++ and Reverse Engineering. In addition to my technical skills, I have experience in presenting my ideas to people with a wide variety of backgrounds. I have demonstrated this in programming competitions, academic presentations and in professional settings. #In addition to my academic experience, I have a strong background in customer service gained through working for the Information Technology Division of my University.
