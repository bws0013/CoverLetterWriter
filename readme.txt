The program takes input from the user (company name and job title) and inputs that information into a cover letter. 
BlankLetter.txt is read in and your job title and company name are inserted into spaces that fit the following format: <Company> will be replaced with the name of the company. <Position> will be replaced by the position entered in. 
Neither Company nor position should end a sentence. If you want to add a carriage return somewhere just enter a # symbol followed by a space. 
To insert your own cover letter just replace the text in BlankLetter.txt and add the Company and position keywords where you see fit.
